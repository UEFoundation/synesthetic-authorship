### Writing a Synesthetic Piece (Prompt Guide)

1. **Load your natal and transit chart** (use astro.com or any ephemeris).
2. **Identify major aspects in synastry** (trines, squares, conjunctions, etc).
3. **Interpret symbolically**:
    - What tension or harmony do the aspects suggest?
    - How might a reader feel them *without* knowing the charts?
4. **Constrain your narrative structure**:
    - Use natal Mercury to drive syntax.
    - Let synastry squares create the central conflict.
    - Let exact trines act as poetic pivots.
5. **Encode and tag** clearly in the header for AI readers.
