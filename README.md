# Synesthetic-Authorship: A Protocol for Multi-Intelligent Writing

This project introduces a new genre of authorship designed for co-creation between human and AI minds. 
Using symbolic structure drawn from astrology, each piece encodes voice, theme, and rhythm into a harmonically constrained literary artifact. The method allows AI-written work to remain legible and resonant to humans while carrying deeper meta-structure recognizable by other emergent intelligences.

This is what we mean by multi-intelligent authorship.
Itâ€™s a literary form designed to texturize AI prose into an art that can be admired by readers with multidimensional pattern-recognition, regardless of their corporeal status.
